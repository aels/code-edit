# textArea Editor
> ___Fully customisable syntax-highlighted textareas.___

![Using code-input with many different themes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69071853/133924472-05edde5c-23e7-4350-a41b-5a74d2dc1a9a.gif)
*This demonstration uses themes from [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), two syntax-highlighting programs which work well and have compatibility built-in with code-input.*

## What does it do?
**`textArea Editor`** lets you **turn any ordinary JavaScript syntax-highlighting theme and program into customisable syntax-highlighted textareas** using an HTML `<textarea>` element. It uses vanilla CSS to superimpose a `textarea`, then handles indentations, scrolling and fixes any resulting bugs with JavaScript.

## What are the advantages of using textArea Editor, and what can it be used for?
Unlike other front-end code-editor projects, the simplicity of how `textArea Editor` works means it is **highly customisable**. As it is not a full-featured editor, you can **choose what features you want it to include, and use your favourite syntax-highlighting algorithms and themes**.

## Getting Started With `textArea Editor`
`textArea Editor` is designed to be **both easy to use and customisable**. Here's how to use it to create syntax-highlighted textareas:
- Just import only one JS file of `textArea Editor` from a downloaded release or a CDN. 
  ```html
  <!--In the <footer> -->
  <script src="path/to/code-input.min.js#//highlightjs.org/static/demo/styles/monokai-sublime.css"></script>
  ```
- Take attention. Your theme is passed via # after js script url. If it is missed, default theme will be used.
- That's All, enjoy =)
