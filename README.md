# textArea Editor
> ___Fully customisable syntax-highlighted textareas.___

## What does it do?
**`textArea Editor`** lets you **turn any ordinary JavaScript syntax-highlighting theme and program into customisable syntax-highlighted textareas** using an HTML `<textarea>` element. It uses vanilla CSS to superimpose a `textarea`, then handles indentations, scrolling and fixes any resulting bugs with JavaScript.

## What are the advantages of using textArea Editor, and what can it be used for?
Unlike other front-end code-editor projects, the simplicity of how `textArea Editor` works means it is **highly customisable**. As it is not a full-featured editor, you can **choose what features you want it to include, and use your favourite syntax-highlighting algorithms and themes**. Also, key value is that `textArea Editor` **saves original textarea** with all event listners on it, so all your scripth will continue to work as before.

## Getting Started With `textArea Editor`
`textArea Editor` is designed to be **both easy to use and customisable**. Here's how to use it to create syntax-highlighted textareas:
- Just import only one JS file of `textArea Editor` from a downloaded release or a CDN. 
  ```html
  <!--In the <footer> -->
  <script src="//aels.github.io/textarea-editor/textarea-editor.js#//highlightjs.org/static/demo/styles/monokai-sublime.css"></script>
  ```
- Take attention. Your theme is passed via # after js script url. If it is missed, default theme will be used.
- That's All, enjoy =)
